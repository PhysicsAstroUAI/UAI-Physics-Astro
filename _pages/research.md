# Research

## Astrophysics
Faculty: <a href="http://www.astro.puc.cl/~rbrahm/">Rafael Brahm</a>, <a href="https://artesliberales.uai.cl/profesor/jorge-cuadra/">Jorge Cuadra</a>, <a href="http://andres-jordan.io/">Andrés Jordán</a>, <a href="http://www.gijsmulders.com/">Gijs Mulders</a> (starting Oct 2020).

We have a strong focus on the discovery and atmospheric characterization of exoplanets, understanding populations of exoplanets and their birthplaces, protoplanetary disks. We work on various ground-based projects such as [HATSouth](https://hatsouth.org/), [HATPI](https://hatpi.org/) and follow-up of space-based missions, most notably [TESS](https://tess.mit.edu/). Regarding the latter, we are a leading group in the discovery of warm giants, loosely defined as giant planets with radii larger than 0.4 Jupiter raii and periods larget than 10 days. We carry out simulations of both planetary system populations to compare with observations and of individual protoplanetary didks to understand planetary formation and disk physics. Additional research topics are small telescope instrumentation and time domain astronomy. 

We carry out numerical simulations of different astrophysical systems, with a focus on the hydrodynamics of accreting objects, such as the Galactic Centre, discs around young binary stars and super-massive black holes, and protoplanetary discs.

## Condensed Matter and Nonlinear Physics
Faculty: <a href="http://www.ncasanova.cl/">Nathalie Casanova</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/andresconchaphysicsresearch/">Andrés Concha</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pmelladouai/home">Paula Mellado</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pmelladouai/home">Alejandro Pereira</a>, <a href="http://www.sergiorica.com/Site/Home.html">Sergio Rica</a>.

Condensed matter nowadays covers several fields of physics, with scales that span many orders of magnitude, and subjects as distant between them as biophysics and topological computing. There are two common threads in the field: the first is that models are primarily concerned with the low energy physics of the system and the second is that the subjects of study have a direct link with natural or man made materials.  The understanding of the current states of matter, of the available materials, and the search for new ones is a vast task with many possible approaches. This is accomplished for instance by studying the transport properties of a system for the understanding of its electronic, magnetic, optical and structural aspects. The diverse strategies have resulted in several sub-disciplines in condensed matter over the years, aiming to improve our understanding of nature, advance fundamental knowledge, predict new phenomena and to be able to manipulate  the physical systems/matter for the benefit of society.

We work in quantum and classical field theories and for that effect it uses theoretical and experimental strategies alike. Examples of the subjects we have investigated include superconductivity, superfluidity, elasticity, fluids, magnetism and semiconductors like graphene.  In particular Professor Sergio Rica focuses mostly in problems related to non linear physics, Professor Andres Concha advocates most of his research to classical field theories like fluids, elasticity and magnetism, and Professor Paula Mellado focuses mostly in problems found in the realm of quantum and classical magnetism. Professor Pereira works on the synthesis, morphological and magnetic characterization of nanostructures and nanostructured materials Professor Casanova focuses on biophysics, developing of nanobiotechnology sensors and nanorheology of proteins.
