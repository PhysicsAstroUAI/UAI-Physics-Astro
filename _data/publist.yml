- title: "Magnetoelectric effect in dipolar clusters"
  image: mellado2020.png
  description: Study about the combination of the anisotropy of magnetic interactions and the point symmetry of finite solids in the study of dipolar clusters as new basic units for multiferroics metamaterials. It is found that the clusters carry spin current and that they manifest the magnetoelectric effect.

- title: "Resonant interaction between dispersive gravitational waves and scalar massive particles"
  image: dummy.jpg
  description: The Klein-Gordon equation is solved in the curved background spacetime created by a dispersive gravitational wave. Unlike solutions of perturbed Einstein equations in vacuum, dispersive gravitational waves do not travel exactly at the speed of light. As a consequence, the gravitational wave can resonantly exchange energy with scalar massive particles.
